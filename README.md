<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Flask application that simulates hearing loss for use as customizable tool for hearing impaired individuals to demonstrate
to others what their auditory experience is like- what they can and cannot hear and how that varies
between situations and environments. This is a proof of concept application for a Capstone Project in Biomedical Engineering.

The application has user profiles that contain audio files and hearing loss data such as audiogram and compression loss.
The user is then able to apply their specific hearing loss to a selected audio files and get a transformed file in return.
The audio simulation is performed with Samuel Garcias HearingLossSimulator python application (linked below)
